# Name of your workflow (appears in GitHub Actions tab)
name: CI/CD Pipeline

# When should this workflow run?
on:
  # Run on every push to main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Run on every pull request targeting main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Allow manual triggering from GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:

# Define the jobs (tasks) to run
jobs:
  # Job 1: Build and Test Backend
  backend-build:
    # What operating system to run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # The directory where backend code lives
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./apps/nest-backend
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Download your code from GitHub
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # Why: Gets your latest code so the pipeline can work with it
      
      # Step 2: Install Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          # Why: Your backend needs Node.js to run
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: ./apps/nest-backend/package-lock.json
      
      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        # Why: npm ci installs exact versions from package-lock.json (faster and more reliable than npm install)
      
      # Step 4: Check code quality (linting)
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint --if-present
        # Why: Catches code style issues and potential bugs
        continue-on-error: true
        # continue-on-error: true means even if linting fails, continue the pipeline
      
      # Step 5: Build the backend
      - name: Build backend
        run: npm run build
        # Why: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and ensures there are no build errors
      
      # Step 6: Run tests (if you have any)
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test --if-present
        # Why: Ensures your code works as expected
        # --if-present means only run if test script exists in package.json

  # Job 2: Build and Test Frontend
  frontend-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./apps/next-frontend/next-frontend-app
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code

        continue-on-error: true
      
      - name: Build frontend
        run: npm run build
        # Why: Builds your Next.js app for production
        env:
          # Add environment variables needed for build
          NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL }}
          # These come from GitHub Secrets (we'll set these up later)
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test --if-present

  # Job 3: Build Docker Images (optional but recommended)
  docker-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Only run if both backend and frontend builds succeed
    needs: [backend-build, frontend-build]
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Setup Docker Buildx (advanced Docker build tool)
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
        # Why: Enables advanced Docker features like caching
      
      # Build backend Docker image
      - name: Build backend Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:

          push: false

          tags: my-backend:latest
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
          # Why: Caching speeds up future builds
      
      # Build frontend Docker image
      - name: Build frontend Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: ./apps/next-frontend/next-frontend-app

# To add deployment later, you would add another job here
# that only runs on the main branch after all tests pass
